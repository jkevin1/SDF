/*
 *	This class represents a FPS counter which uses glfwGetTime and an exponential moving average function to
 *	calculate the average frame time.  Alpha represents the weight of the most recent frame, a higher value
 *	will cause older frames to have less of an effect.  Setting alpha = 2 / (N + 1) will make the last N frames
 *	account for approximately 86% of the average frame times.  This class can automatically report the FPS.
